  /*!
    A PainterAttributeDataFillerGlyphs is for filling the data of a
    PainterAttributeDataFiller for the purpose of drawing glyphs.
    The enumeration glyph_type provide the indices into
    PainterAttributeData::attribute_data_chunks() and
    PainterAttributeData::index_data_chunks() for the different
    glyph types. If a glyph is not uploaded to its GlyphCache and
    failed to be uploaded to its GlyphCache, then filling will
    only fill the PainterAttrributeData to the last glyph that
    successfully uploaded to its GlyphCache. That value can be
    queried by number_glyphs(). If all glyphs are uploaded or
    successfully loaded, then number_glyphs() returns the number
    glyph in the glyph run. Data for glyphs is packed as follows:
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib0 .xy   -> xy-texel location in primary atlas (float)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib0 .zw   -> xy-texel location in secondary atlas (float)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib1 .xy -> position in item coordinates (float)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib1 .z  -> 0 (free)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib1 .w  -> 0 (free)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib2 .x -> 0 (free)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib2 .y -> glyph offset (uint)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib2 .z -> layer in primary atlas (uint)
      - PainterAttribute::m_attrib2 .w -> layer in secondary atlas (uint)
