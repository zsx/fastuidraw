  /*!
    A GlyphRenderDataCurvePair represents the data needed
    to build a scalable glyph that uses a curve-pair
    analytic algorithm for rendering. A texel can have
    up to two curves intersecting it. If there are two
    curves, then they must be neighbor curves of a contour
    of the generating glyph.The glyphs must be rendered at
    a sufficient resolution so that when rendering glyphs,
    hinting does not play any significant role AND if for
    each texel, if more that one curve intersects a texel,
    then it is only two and those curves are neighbors.

    Data is uploaded to atlas as follows:
       * values in CurvePairGlyphData::m_active_curve_pair are converted
         as follows:
          * CurvePairGlyphData::completely_empty_texel is realized as 0
          * CurvePairGlyphData::completely_full_texel is realized as 1
          * all other values are stored as the original value plus 2
          * if all the converted values are no more than 255, then the valus are
            stored in the texel backing store at Glyph::atlas_location().
          * if atleast one coverted value is atleast 256, then the lower 8-bits
            of each value are in the texel backing store at Glyph::atlas_location()
            and the high 8-bits are stored at Glyph::secondary_atlas_location()
       * The curve pair data is packed into the geometry backing store of the atlas
         with the location a multiple of GlyphAtlasTexelBackingStoreBase::blocks_per_curvepair_entry().
         Each entry is takes up GlyphAtlasTexelBackingStoreBase::blocks_per_curvepair_entry()
         blocks and the values are packed according to the enumeration CurvePairGlyphData::geometry_packing.
         In addition, the value for CurvePairGlyphData::entry::m_p is incremented by
         Glyph::atlas_location().location(). By doing so, the computation of coverage
         needs only the texel coordinate (because the curve data is effectively moved to
         the coordinates of texel coordinates).
