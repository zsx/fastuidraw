    Represents the interface for the backing store for the texels
    of a sequence of color stops. The expectation is that linear
    filtering acting on the underlying backing store is all that
    is needed for correct color interpolation from a gradient
    interpolate. For example in GL, this can be GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY
    with both minification and magnification filters set as GL_LINEAR.
    An implementation of the class does NOT need to be thread safe
    because the user of the backing store (ColorStopAtlas) performs
    calls to the backing store behind its own mutex.
