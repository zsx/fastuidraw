  \brief
  Provides interface for application to use GL and for application
  to specify to FastUIDraw GL backend how to get GL function pointers.
  Part of the GL backend libraries, libFastUIDrawGL and libFastUIDrawGLES.

  Short version:
   - application should call fastuidraw::gl_binding::get_proc_function()
     to set the function which the GL backend for FastUIDraw will use to
     fetch GL function pointers.
   - If an application wishes, it can include <fastuidraw/gl_backend/ngl_header.hpp>.
     The header will replace GL (and GLES) functions with macros. Under release
     the macros are to function pointers that automatically set themselves up
     correcty. For debug, the macros preceed and postceed each GL (and GLES)
     function call with error checking call backs so an application writer
     can quickly know what line/file triggered a GL error. If an application does
     not wish to use the macro system (and will also need to fetch function pointers
     somehow) but remain GL/GLES agnostic, it can instead include <fastuidraw/gl_backend/gl_header.hpp>.

  Long Version:

  The namespace gl_binding provides an interface for an application
  to specify to the GL module of FastUIDraw how to fetch function
  pointers (fastuidraw::gl_binding::get_proc_function()) and additional
  functionality of where to write/store GL error messages. An application
  can also use this functionality by including <fastuidraw/gl_backend/ngl_header.hpp>.
  The header <fastuidraw/gl_backend/ngl_header.hpp> will create a macro
  for each GL function. If GL_DEBUG is defined, each GL call will be preceded by
  a callback and postceeded by another call back. If logging
  is on (see log_gl_commands(bool)), the precede call back
  will print (file, line and arguments) to the LoggerBase
  object specified by gl_binding::logger(LoggerBase*). The post-process
  call back will call glGetError until no errors are returned and
  log the call and errors to the LoggerBase object specified with
  gl_binding::logger(LoggerBase*). If logging is on (see
  gl_binding::log_gl_commands(bool)) then regardless of any errors
  a log message will be written indicating the GL call
  succeeded.

  This is implemented by creating a macro for each
  GL call. If GL_DEBUG is not defined, none of these
  logging and error calls backs are executed.
  The mechanism is implemented by defining a macro
  for each GL function, hence using a GL function
  name as a function pointer will fail to compile
  and likely give an almost impossible to read
  error message. To use this, an application needs to
  only include <fastuidraw/gl_backend/ngl_header.hpp>.

  To fetch the function pointer of a GL function,
  use the macro <B>FASTUIDRAWglfunctionPointer</B> together
  with <B>FASTUIDRAWglfunctionExists</B>. The macro
  <B>FASTUIDRAWglfunctionPointer</B> will NEVER return
  a nullptr pointer. For the cases where the GL implementation
  does not have tha function, the function pointer
  returned will then point to a do-nothing function.
  To check if a GL implementation has a given function
  use the macro-function <B>FASTUIDRAWglfunctionExists</B>
  which returns non-zero if the GL implementation has
  the function. Some example code:

  \code
  //get a function pointer for a GL function
  //which takes no arguments and returns nothing.
  void (*functionPointer)(void) = nullptr;
  if(FASTUIDRAWglfunctionExists(glSomething)
    {
      functionPointer = FASTUIDRAWglfunctionPointer(glSomeFunction);
    }
  else
    {
      //FASTUIDRAWglfunctionPointer(glSomeFunction) is NOT nullptr,
      //rather it maps to a no-op function.
      //in this example we leave the value of
      //functionPointer as nullptr to indicate the function
      //is not supported by the GL implementation.
    }
  \endcode

  Calling a GL function through a function pointer
  will bypass the GL error checking though. One issue
  with using FASTUIDRAWglfunctionExists is that a number
  of GL implementations will return a function pointer,
  even if the implementation does not support it. As
  always, when fetching function pointers, one should
  check the GL version and GL extension string(s) to
  know if the GL implementation supports that function.

  The gl_binding system requires that an application provides
  a function which the binding system uses to fetch function
  pointers for the GL API, this is set via
  gl_binding::get_proc_function().
